        <h3>Bio:</h3>
        <p>I'm a highly driven individual with a deep passion for coding and software development, always seeking to expand my knowledge in this ever-evolving industry. Over the years, I’ve worked independently on various projects, leading to the successful publication of multiple apps on the App Store. This hands-on experience has sharpened my technical skills and deepened my understanding of the fast-paced world of tech.</p>

          <p>Before diving into software development, my career spanned multiple industries. I worked as a small business lender, helping individuals and businesses secure the funding they needed to pursue their dreams. Additionally, I’ve ventured into creative fields as a clothing designer and graphic designer, where I combined my entrepreneurial mindset with artistic expression. As an investor, I’ve explored new opportunities to grow and diversify my interests, always seeking the next challenge.
          </p>
          <p>These experiences, from running businesses to fostering creativity and financial empowerment, have shaped my problem-solving abilities and entrepreneurial spirit. At the heart of everything I do is my 3-year-old daughter, Brooklynn Brown, who inspires me every day. My journey is one of continuous growth, fueled by the desire to set an example for her—showing that hard work, persistence, and a thirst for learning can lead to boundless success.</p>
